Begin with a television commercial, a cheap production, low resolution, scratchy. A muscular man, a gravel-voiced professional wrestler dressed as Uncle Sam with crossed arms and scowling face.
UNCLE SAM
Some people say America has lost the ability to create good products. Some people say America has lost the will to work . . . Well, to those people, I have one thing to say . . . 
A song starts in the background of the commercial, a poor quality version of John Phillips Sousa’s Stars and Stripes. Uncle Sam rips off his coat, revealing a snug-fitting singlet that exposes massive arms, chiseled chest, six-pack abs, and the words AMERICA STILL WORKS! He points into the camera. 
UNCLE SAM
America Still Works!
The commercial switches to a montage of shots showing large semi-trailer trucks rolling past U.S. landmarks and icons: the Golden Gate Bridge, the Seattle Space Needle, Las Vegas, the St. Louis arch, Manhattan. The drivers wave or blow their horns, and on the side of each trailer, in huge type, are the words AMERICA STILL WORKS!
The commercial switches back to Uncle Sam, who is now standing on a mezzanine above a nondescript manufacturing bay. In the background, distant figures in blue jumpsuits mechanically perform jobs at workstations. There is something wrong with the figures: they move in a way that reminds us of robots, but we can’t see them clearly. 
UNCLE SAM
Business managers, if you love America, you need America Still Works! 
ZOOM OUT ON TELEVISION COMMERCIAL, KEEPING IN BACKGRROUND WITHOUT SOUND. 
ARJUN DASARI, a twenty-something account representative for the Indian outsourcing firm Happy Staff LLC is speaking off screen. 
ARJUN (V.O.)
It was my first year in America. My first American Halloween. My first American hurricane. My first time living so far away from my family. If I only knew then what I know now.
Well, let’s just say I still get the creeps anytime I see somebody in zombie make-up.
And to think it all started during the Cold War between the United States and the former Soviet Union . . . or, at least that is what Dr. Shevosky, who was there at the beginning, told us . . .
FADE OUT
A SONG PLAYS: BLACK SABBATH’S “CHILDREN OF THE GRAVE.”
FADE UP ON:
EXT. - AERIAL SHOT FROM HELICOPTER, PLUM ISLAND – DAY
Begin with loud sound of a helicopter, and slowly fade in to show a view through the helicopter window. The image has a Kodachrome look to it, like a picture shot in the 70s. (Each time we see Plum Island, it will look this way.)
A small island grows close. 
SUPER: 1975, PLUM ISLAND ANIMAL RESEARCH LABORATORY, OFF LONG ISLAND, NEW YORK
SONG FADES
CUT TO: SHAKING INTERIOR OF CRAFT FILLED WITH MEN IN GREEN ARMY FATIGUES AND ONE CIVILIAN. 
CLOSE ON: DR. STEVEN MENTZER AND COLONEL TRENT MASTERSON.
Mentzer, a bespectacled young man in his twenties studies pages in a bound report. On the deck lie two stretchers covered by bloodstained sheets; the shapes beneath are human. 
COLONEL MASTERSON, a lean, tanned man sits next to Mentzer. He chews an unlit cigar. 
MASTERSON
Hope you know what you’re doing doc. Got my ass sticking way out on this one. This super-soldier project of yours flops, and my career flops. 
Masterson removes the cigar from his mouth, studies it for a moment with a frown, and then reinserts it. 
Mentzer continues reading. 
MASTERSON
I’m counting on making general before I turn fifty. 
MENTZER	
Mentzer continues reading, showing no appearance of having heard the colonel until he suddenly responds.
We are on the verge of a new era in warfare, Colonel. If my experiments succeed, the American soldier will become virtually indestructible. 
Needless to say, the officer who introduces the indestructible soldier will be invincible in his own way.  
Masterson grimaces, removes the cigar from mouth, and studies it again for a moment before reinserting it. 
MASTERSON
So you say, doc, but nothing good comes without a measure of bad. 
MENTZER
(Still reading, still not looking up.)
The side effects have been small and easily contained. I wouldn’t worry if I were you.
Masterson studies Dr. Mentzer for a second, glancing at the report the doctor is reading. You sense that the colonel would like to grab the report and throw it out a window. 
MASTERSON
My job is to worry. My orders are to make sure anything that goes wrong stays on this island.
Mentzer smiles smugly; he looks up to better share his ingratiatingly smug smile.
MENTZER
My research indicates an eighty-seven percent success rate, even with massive wounds that would normally be fatal. The failures are benign or easily handled. This project will succeed. 
There are even commercial opportunities I am pursuing.
MASTERSON
Easily handled, huh? We talking monkeys?
Mentzer hesitates slightly before answering.
	MENTZER	
Rats . . . We have been testing rats.
But the process is transferable to humans!
Signaling that he has said all he plans to say, Mentzer continues reading his report. 
MASTERSON
(Speaking to himself.) 
Rats! Jesus Christ!
CUT TO: HELICOPTER LANDING.
The door of the helicopter opens; the soldiers disembark, carrying the two stretchers. Colonel Masterson and Mentzer are last to emerge. A man in a white lab coat (DR. ARSENY SHEVOSKY) exits the nearest building, waves, and walks toward them. 
MASTERSON
Can’t say I understand why we need all these damned Rooskies. I don’t trust the commie bastards. 
Mentzer adjusts his glasses.
MENTZER
Science doesn’t have political boundaries, Colonel. Dr. Arseny Shevosky is one of the preeminent authorities on viruses. With his help, we will know in days if we are on the right track. I trust him—so should you.
Dr. Shevosky arrives and sticks out his hand to Mentzer. He speaks with a Russian accent. 
SHEVOSKY
Doctor Mentzer! Is beautiful day, da?
MENTZER
Indeed doctor; a beautiful day. Unfortunately, we will spend it inside, won’t we?
Shevosky shrugs and smiles in agreement. You sense that he does not like Mentzer either.
SHEVOSKY
It is the price we pay for being scientists, no? Surely, there will be other beautiful days? 
We are very close this time, I think.
MENTZER
Has Ivan prepared the injections, as I instructed?
SHEVOSKY
All is ready. We are quite excited.
As if seeing him for the first time, Shevosky looks to Colonel Masterson. 
SHEVOSKY
Colonel, the subjects were, I presume, chosen carefully? These were men with no families, nobody to remember them?
Masterson removes his cigar and spits, never taking his eyes from Shevosky. He does not answer.
MENTZER
Both men were orphans and had no close friends outside of the military. No one will inquire about them. 
Shevosky nods, wilting under the colonel’s gaze. 
SHEVOSKY
Those who are not scientists . . . they do not always understand science. They do not appreciate the sacrifices that must be made in pursuit of knowledge.
Masterson grunts, pulls out his cigar, and spits on the ground at Shevosky’s feet. 
MASTERSON
Americans know sacrifice all too well Boris! I can name dozens who sacrificed everything to cut out a cancer of evil intent on dominating the world . . . They should cut deeper; pieces of the tumor have re-surfaced too close to home for my taste!
Masterson continues staring at Shevosky, who blanches and turns back to Mentzer.
MENTZER
The success of this project will silence those who believe all Russians are cut from the same cloth, Dr. Shevosky. You are writing a new history here, for Ivan and yourself.
SHEVOSKY
Da. Let us hope it is a good one... Come! 
Shevosky and Mentzer walk to the building while Masterson looks on, disapprovingly.
CUT TO:
INT. - PLUM ISLAND LABORATORY - DAY
Shevosky, Mentzer, and DR. IVAN NEVISKY talk in front of two cloth-draped bodies that lie on stainless steel tables in b.g. 
NEVISKY
All is ready. You are sure these men died less than six hours ago?
MENTZER
Both died in an auto pool accident in New Jersey less than two hours ago. 
NEVISKY
How they die?
MENTZER
I don’t see what difference it makes how they died, Dr. Nevisky, but I don’t mind telling you. A truck fell on them when the lift holding it up failed. The base commander contacted us, and we flew them here immediately. Very sad. 
NEVISKY
And these men, they had no . . .
MENTZER
(Briskly, annoyed.) 
They were orphans . . . as I have already told Dr. Shevosky. 
Ivan nods. 
NEVISKY
Two orphans, working together, are killed in the same accident . . .
MENTZER
(Peevishly.) 
A coincidence Dr. Nevisky! . . . A tragedy for these men, of course, but a lucky coincidence for us.
I, for one, choose not to question providence, doctor. 
SHEVOSKY
Looks briefly at Mentzer and nods. He wants to leave this topic.
Da . . . I too sense a divine hand at work. Perhaps it is a sign? 
Shevosky turns to Mentzer, smiles cheerily, and gestures to the door. 
SHEVOSKY
Ivan and I can administer the injections, Dr. Mentzer. Surely, you must be tired after your journey; helicopters are not the most relaxing way to travel. 
Mentzer’s eyes focus on Shevosky, Nevisky, the two bodies in the background, and back to Shevosky. 
MENTZER
Yes. There was considerable vibration, and I had to field questions from that idiot colonel . . .
SHEVOSKY
Refresh yourself! Return once you are rested. Ivan and I will take care of the preliminary work. 
Mentzer nods and slowly walks OFFSCREEN. 
Nevisky turns to Shevosky. He nods at the bodies. 
NEVISKY
Tell me Arseny, have we escaped one master only to fall into the clutches of another? Just when we are in need of two bodies to test the human virus . . . 
Shevosky raises a finger to his lips while his eyes dart about the room. He then speaks loudly, trying to project a sense of belief in what they are doing. 
SHEVOSKY
Ah! You are thinking too much, Ivan! There are many soldiers stationed nearby; such a coincidence was inevitable here in the land of the free . . .
Come, let us get started!
Ivan takes Shevosky’s cue. He turns and grabs a syringe from a table next to the bodies. 
IVAN
(Loudly)
Yes. Of course! I am sure I must just be imagining things. We are no longer in the Soviet Union, after all. 
Let us get started!

OUT OF FRAME: A spoon CLINKING in a bowl, followed by CRUNCHING; somebody is eating cereal loudly. 
SONG FADES
CLOSE ON: TV PLAYING SACCHARIN MORNING NEWS PROGRAM (KHMX—PROUDLY SERVING THE HOUSTON METROPLEX!)
A perky young woman (HAYLEE) is speaking, interacting with MICHAEL, the easily-excitable morning news anchor.
MICHAEL
So, Haylee, have you decided what you are wearing for Halloween tonight?
HAYLEE
Well, Michael, I was planning to dress as Cleopatra, but, like many other Houstonians, I will be holed up in a safe shelter tonight, riding out Hurricane Claudette. 
MICHAEL
(Laughing)
Roger that Haylee! I plan to dress in my rain poncho right here at the KHMX newsroom.
HAYLEE
Save me a seat!
MICHAEL
You know I will!
Both laugh fake television laughs. 
MICHAEL
(Stops laughing and affixes serious look to his face.)
So tell us about this new downward trend in prison populations. What’s happening there?
HAYLEE
Well, Michael, it is difficult to cite a specific reason for the decline. Burglary is down a half percent in the past year, and violent crimes are down about the same, but the prison population has declined nearly five percent. 
MICHAEL
Wow! That is incredible! What do the prison authorities have to say?
HAYLEE 
(Frowning thoughtfully) 
Interesting you should ask, Michael. I spoke with the warden of the Huntsville Prison yesterday, and he suggested that the decline is result of an overall drop in crime combined with enhanced rehabilitation programs. In particular, the warden cited a work placement program with the labor outsourcing firm America Still Works! as having a beneficial impact. 
MICHAEL
(Frowning thoughtfully too) 
That’s might interesting Haylee! 
(Smiling!) 
Thanks for the update! We’ll be back after this quick message! 
The newscast switches to a commercial, a slick, professional production. On screen, a muscular man dressed as Uncle Sam, arms crossed, speaks.
UNCLE SAM
Some people say America has lost the ability to create good products. Some people say America has lost the will to work . . . Well, to those people, I have one thing to say . . . 
Uncle Sam rips off his coat, revealing a snug-fitting singlet that exposes massive arms, chiseled chest, six-pack abs, and the words AMERICA STILL WORKS! He points into the camera. 
UNCLE SAM
America Still Works!
CUT TO: SPOKESMAN IN SUIT (OLDER MENTZER)
MENTZER
Hi. I’m Dr. Steven Mentzer, chairman and CEO of America Still Works! Like you, I am an American who believes in the greatness of this country. 
If you manufacture a product, and it disgusts you to have to outsource or hire illegal workers, I encourage you to contact America Still Works! 
Together, we can keep America strong and prosperous!
CUT TO: UNCLE SAM 
Now flanked by two other muscled compatriots: a man in work khakis and a woman in a tight-fitting business dress that reveals bodybuilder legs.
UNCLE SAM
(Sneering) I hate the word outsourcing . . . almost as much as I hate illegal aliens taking American jobs! 
Keep American strong! America Still Works!
SWITCH TO NEWS BROADCAST
MICHAEL
In other news, Texas distributors and manufacturers seem to be continuing the strong comeback we spoke of last year. . . 
Television sounds fade into the background while sounds of a spoon clinking against an empty bowl take the focus. Hands set the bowl and spoon on the table. 
CUT TO: UNSHAVEN FACE OF YOUNG INDO-ARYAN MAN
ARJUN DASARI scratches his face. He is standing, wearing a white tee shirt and boxer shorts. 
He walks from the kitchen to the bedroom, past a dresser on which stands a picture of three people, a sliding closet door, and into the bathroom. A television mounted on the bathroom wall continues the morning news program; this time, the reporter is a somber-looking young Asian man
REPORTER
. . . the sudden resurgence of Texas manufacturing has been keenly felt here, in China, where factories that had been making products are now shuttered. Just behind me is a plant that used to build consumer products that are once again being made in the Lone Star State. According to a company spokesperson . . .
SOUND FADES BEHIND BUZZING OF ELECTRIC RAZOR. 
A window on the television screen opens, showing the face of Arjun as he shaves. He runs the razor across both cheeks, chin, below his nose, and his neck. He appraises his work, shuts off the razor, and walks out of the bathroom. As he shuts off the razor, the window showing his face closes. 
He walks back into the bedroom and opens the closet door next to the dresser. 
FOCUS ON DRESSER. THE PICTURE ON THE DRESSER SHOWS ARJUN, A WOMAN, AND A YOUNG GIRL, PRESUMABLY HIS WIFE AND DAUGHTER. 
FOCUS ON TELEVISION
Sounds of fabric rustling in the background as Arjun dresses.
MICHAEL
Thanks Wei. I guess it won’t be long before Chinese consumers start seeing products stamped Made in America! 
WEI smiles weakly. 
WEI
Something like that.  
MICHAEL
Speaking of other things that are declining, the federal government says illegal immigration continues to drop. CONSUELA Guerrero of sister station KVIA brings us the latest from El Paso. Consuela?
CONSUELA
Michael, here in El Paso, just across the border from Ciudad Juárez, we continue to see the effects of the rapid decline in illegal border crossings. In fact, some Homeland Security officials I spoke with are suggesting that the movement appears to be from Texas to Mexico . . .
A PHONE RINGS. 
ARJUN
Pick up!  
THE TELEVISION SCREEN SWITCHES TO A HEAD-ON IMAGE OF ANOTHER INDO-ARYAN MAN (DAMAN, PRESIDENT AND CEO OF HAPPY STAFF OUTSOURCING, LLC)
ARJ
I’ll be there in two minutes
DAMAN
You were supposed to be here five minutes ago! They’re hinting about dropping us. Get in here now if you want to keep your job!
ARJ
I’m there!
DAMAN
And clear the mess off your desk!
ARJUN 
Yes. Yes, of course!
Daman hangs up. 
Arjun tightens his tie, looks down briefly, sighs, and springs out the bedroom still wearing only his boxer shorts beneath his dress shirt. He skids down a short hall and slides through an open doorway into his home office.
On the wall, a large screen shows a weather reporter who is discussing a large hurricane in the Gulf of Mexico. 
WEATHER REPORTER
. . . because of its size, covering much of the gulf, some observers are already comparing Claudette to Hurricane Ike, which came ashore near Galveston in 2008. The big difference is intensity: Ike made landfall as a Category 2 storm, while Claudette looks to be a strong Category 3 when it hits the Texas coast tomorrow morning. Authorities advise all those remaining in the metroplex to leave . . .
In front of the screen is a desk, on which can be seen a keypad atop stacks of paper, magazines, and fast-food packages. In one corner of the desk is another picture of Arjun, a woman, and a small girl.  
ARJUN picks up the keyboard and uses his other hand to sweep everything except for the picture onto the floor. He sits in a chair in front of the desk, facing the large screen on the wall, and types. 
The news broadcast ends abruptly, replaced by the unsmiling face of Daman in one pane and the equally unsmiling faces of two Caucasian men in two other panes. The men are dressed for Halloween: the older man is wearing a Lone Ranger outfit; the younger man is dressed as Tonto.
ARJUN
Sorry for the inconvenience, gentlemen. I was doing a little last-minute research on ways to trim costs for Prost! Distributing! 
FOCUS ON: MIDDLE PANE OF THE SCREEN. 
SUPER: ROBERT “BOB” BRUNER, 62. CHAIRMAN OF THE BOARD OF PROST! DISTRIBUTING.
BOB
That’s a good thing, but unless you’re trimming with a dadgum cleaver, I don’t see the numbers working. . . Besides, we want to staff our customer service centers with people who, if you will pardon my saying so, speak the way our customers do. 
ARJUN
(Affecting a bad Texas accent) Well, shoot, pardners, speaking the lingo is one of our specialties at Happy Staff! We have operators trained in all the local dialects . . . dadgummit! 
Normally, we charge extra for talking the talk, but, for a long-time partner like Prost!, I’m sure our head honcho can make some adjustments; right Daman?
Daman smiles and nods. He opens his mouth to speak, but the man in the right pane of the screen speaks first. 
FOCUS ON: RIGHT PANE
SUPER: ROBERT BRUNER II, AKA “ZWEI”, 37, PRESIDENT AND CEO,PROST! DISTRIBUTING. 
ZWEI
I don’t think you’re picking up on our vibe here, honcho. What Daddy is trying to say is that the days of outsourcing are over for Prost! Distributing. 
We can now afford to staff our own call centers, right here, close to our new distribution warehouse . . . We’re pulling the plug on ya’ll.
ARJUN
Wait . . . What? . . . How? Just last month you said real estate costs were too high, fuel costs were too high, and labor costs were simply impossible. 
ZWEI
All true.
ARJUN
Nothing has changed! Real-estate costs are down, but fuel costs are still high, and labor costs, what with health care premiums going through the roof, are higher than ever. 
Unless you’ve convinced people to work for nothing, your labor costs alone would prohibit U.S-based distribution.
BOB
(Beat) Let’s just say we found a way to slash those labor costs. 
ARJUN
But Prost! and Happy Staff have had a long and mutually-prosperous history of working together! You can’t just cut us off like this!
ZWEI
Heck yeah we can! Our high-priced Ivy League lawyers tell us either party can unilaterally decide to end the agreement at any time. Ain’t that right Daddy?
BOB	
It’s the dang truth! We can, and we are. 
ARJUN
Wait a minute! Let’s talk about this . . .
Arjun stands up, notices everybody staring at his underwear, and promptly sits back down. 
BOB
Ain’t nothing left to talk about. 
ZWEI
Aside from the fact that you need to get some big-boy pants there pardner!
BOB
We’re pulling the plug. The bathtub is a draining!
ZWEI
Pulling the plug, baby! Glug, glug, glug! 
ARJUN
Bathtub? What . . . wait!
The panes showing the Bruners abruptly close, leaving Arjun staring at a glowering Daman. 
ARJUN
(Shaking head) 
This is not my fault, man. Not my fault. You heard them: they figured a way to cut labor costs. 
DAMAN
Which is why I’m not firing you on the spot. 
ARJUN
(Relieved) 
You’re not? Thanks man. I won’t forget this. My family and I owe . . .
DAMAN
Find out why they don’t need us anymore. There is something going on with our Texas accounts. We’ve lost others, and I want to know why!
ARJUN
Sure man. No problem. I’ll check out a couple of sources I know, and . . .
DAMAN
You’ll go to their distribution center personally and see what they are doing! 
ARJUN
Sure . . . I can do that. No problem. I’ll just bop over there after the storm and . . .
DAMAN
During the storm! 
ARJUN
(Beat) Are you crazy? There’s a big-ass hurricane hours away from hitting this place. Everybody with any sense left two days ago. 
DAMAN
Exactly! Nobody is going to be there, so you should have no problem getting in. 
ARJUN
That’s breaking and entering! I could get arrested. They have alarms. 
DAMAN
(Smiling) 
Thousands of alarms must go off during a hurricane. I suspect the overwhelmed authorities ignore most of them. 
ARJUN
I could get killed!
DAMAN
(Shrugs) 
There’s always that chance. 
Arjun stares for a second at Daman’s image, at the picture of his wife and daughter, and slowly realizes he has no choice. 
ARJUN
Damn!

SUPER: OCTOBER 1976
We see a grassy field, about the size of a football field, lined with tall fencing topped with concertina wire. On one side is the ocean and on the other an observation tower sits just beyond the fence. At either end are recessed concrete bunkers with metal doors.
SONG FADES
CUT TO: 
A cigar-chewing Colonel Masterson and Dr. Mentzer stand together in the tower, watching as pale re-animated soldiers advance from one bunker into machine gun fire coming from the other bunker. Making no efforts to protect themselves, the slow-moving soldiers are cut to pieces. The pieces keep trying to move after being shot off. 
Masterson grunts in disgust.
MASTERSON
Mother of Mercy on a Monday! Is this the best you can do, doctor? All those things would accomplish is to gross the enemy out. 
MENTZER
The virus . . . It works at a lower body temperature, so the reanimated soldiers are . . . slow.

In the background, dancers in bikinis, cowboy boots, and cowboy hats perform on a mechanical bull, lasso each other, and get ridden by other dancers in a raunchy rodeo pantomime. 
On all of the walls of the bar, large-screen televisions soundlessly show news, football, World Series baseball, and the Weather Channel.

Aliens? America is kicking out aliens?
PEDRO
Jesus, guys! Don’t be dropping the A-word around Rosa like that.
BOBBY N
(Looking at Rosa) 
No worry. I not talk about your kind of alien. I talk about alien from outer space who come, kill people. 
BILLY N
And sometimes fuck people in ass just for fun . . . Most times fuck people in ass just for fun.

OSCAR
You guys are a piece of work.

Unbelievable!
Arjun points to the television.
ARJUN
Check this out!
On the screen is a satellite image of Hurricane Claudette, which fills the entire Gulf of Mexico. The leading edge of the gargantuan storm is touching the Texas shore. An arrow pops up to show the direction in which the eye of the hurricane is moving. The tip of the arrow is on Houston.

Arjun continues watching the television while the dancers gyrate to the strains of WHITE ZOMBIE’S “I’M YOUR BOOGIE MAN,” FROM THE SUPERSEXY ALBUM. 
The Weather Channel guy can’t be heard, but a graphic on the screen shows Claudette has reached Category 3 and seems to be strengthening.

Fuck you guys!
BILLY N
Glaring at Arjun.
At least you not send American jobs overseas like some people. 
ARJUN
(Lifts head and looks at Billy N.)
Happy Staff helps American companies provide cost-effective services they can’t provide here because of high labor costs.
BOBBY N
Sound like communist propaganda. American workers best in world, deserve best pay! 
PEDRO
Maybe they could have more if American executives didn’t pay themselves hundreds of times what their workers make. 
BILLY N
That true. American executives mostly dickheads! 
BOBBY N
I rather deport them than illegals! 
FOCUS ON ROSA, WHO IS BLUSHING. 
OSCAR
(Loudly.)
Damn you guys! Can’t you have any sensitivity? Rosa is an illegal! 
Rosa looks even more uncomfortable. 
ARJUN
Shout it, why don’t you? I don’t think everybody in the bar heard you. 
Oscar blushes and quickly looks about. 
In the background, the dancers are now gyrating to the strains of KORN’S “Y'ALL WANT A SINGLE SAY FUCK THAT,” punctuating the key line by flipping the bird at the satellite image of Claudette on the television. 
PEDRO
I don’t think anybody here is sober enough to hear or remember anything. 
As they watch, the news shifts to a story titled “Illegals streaming back across border.” A reporter is standing at the border between El Paso and Juarez. In the background, people push to get across the bridge into Mexico. 
ARJUN
What is up with this crazy rush to leave Texas? 
Focus on Rosa, who swallows hard. 
ROSA
I hear stories about bad things happening to illegals. 
ARJUN
What could they possibly do except deport you? It costs too much to keep illegals in jail. 
ROSA
I heard people say they do experiments on illegals. 
Arjun, Pedro, Billy N, Bobby N, and Oscar contemplate what Rosa has said and then burst out laughing.
On the television, a muscular young man wearing a white tee shirt with the words American Still Works! shoves his way into view behind the reporter and points to his chest. 
OSCAR

SUPER: DECEMBER, 1976
Shevosky and Mentzer look at a dead body strapped to a table. Nevisky stabs the corpse with a syringe and pushes the plunger. On the other side stands a soldier with a rifle at the ready. 
Another table, oriented 90 degrees to the table holding the body, supports a camcorder recording the experiment. Next to the camcorder is a television and a remote control. 
Nevisky finishes and steps back, next to the television.

NEVISKY
This new variant should give the re-animates more speed. 
MENTZER
It better. Masterson keeps reminding me that our first demonstration was not promising from a military perspective. Frankly, I agree with him.
NEVISKY
I should expect at least a ten-fold increase in energy . . .
SHEVOSKY
Look out!
The reanimated body TEARS RESTRAINTS on far side and lunges. It grabs Nevisky’s arm and bites ferociously. 
The soldier aims his rifle but cannot fire because Nevisky is in the way. 
Instinctively, Nevisky leans away, his free hand coming to rest upon the REMOTE CONTROL. 
CLOSE ON: LIGHT EMITTING FROM END OF REMOTE CONTROL.
The body gnawing Nevisky’s arm suddenly relaxes, becomes almost passive. It still stares at Nevisky’s arm and licks the blood on its lips, but it does not move otherwise except for periodic shudders. 
CLOSE ON: SOLDIER’S FINGER TIGHTENING ON THE TRIGGER. 
MENZTER
Stop! Don’t shoot!
SHEVOSKY
Goddammit it! It attacked Ivan!
MENTZER
Yes. But it stopped. Why?
INTERCUT BETWEEN: Body’s face, Nevisky’s bleeding arm, soldier waiting to fire, Nevisky’s free hand smashed upon the television remote that is pointed at the reanimated body. 
Shevosky moves forward, motioning the soldier to the head of the table where he will have a clear shot. The body’s eyes follow the motion, but the body does not move. 
MENTZER
Don’t shoot unless I give the order! 
SHEVOSKY. 
If it moves, shoot it. 
SOLDIER
Yes sir!
SHEVOSKY
Ivan! I am going to take the remote control from beneath your hand. Keep the button pressed down.
Nevisky nods, his eyes wide in shock. 
CLOSE ON: SHEVOSKY’S TREMBLING HAND.
Sliding his hand beneath Nevisky’s, Shevosky presses down on the button Nevisky had inadvertently pressed. Shevosky slowly pulls the remote out, keeping it pointed at the body. He steps between Nevisky and the body, pushing Nevisky out of the way. 
Nevisky, grasping his arm, stumbles out the door of the lab. 
Shevosky steps back, keeping the remote pointed at the body, which watches with passive interest, until he stands next to the soldier. 
SHEVOSKY
I will try something. 
SOLDIER
Yes sir!
SHEVOSKY
I will release this button . . . for a moment. If the creature reacts, don’t shoot immediately; I will press the button again. I think signal from this remote calms him, but I want to be sure. Do you understand?
SOLDIER
Yes sir! I will give you a chance to control him . . . But if he starts to come over that table . . .
SHEVOSKY
If he comes over that table, shoot him. 
MENTZER
No! You are not to shoot! This is government property!
Neither the soldier nor Shevosky pay any attention to Mentzer. 
SHEVOSKY
Here is going nothing. 
SPLIT SCREEN: SHEVOSKY’S FINGER, ZOMBIE’S FACE. 
As the finger moves off the button, the button rises, and the body’s face goes from passive to snarling. The finger moves back down, and the snarl disappears. The body has not moved, but it continues to jerk periodically, as though not under perfect control. 
Shevosky and the soldier heave a sigh of relief; Shevosky looks at the remote. 
SHEVOSKY
Most interesting. 
SOLDIER
Yes sir! Whatever you say!

EXT. - PLUM ISLAND TEST FIELD – DAY
SUPER: OCTOBER 1977
A cigar-chewing Colonel Masterson and Dr. Mentzer stand together in an observation tower, watching two emaciated re-animated soldiers emerge through the open doors of a bunker. 
In the center of the field is a tall pole atop which sits a box from which a dozen cylinders protrude radially, covering 360 degrees. 
SONG FADES
MENTZER
Today, I will show you the fast virus we developed following last year’s trial. 
MASTERSON
Was this before or after your Rooskies left?
MENTZER
(Beat) Doctors Shevosky and Nevisky were involved in the discovery, but we have managed quite well without them. 
MASTERSON
(Looking at field)
Those poor bastards don’t look any faster than before. Skinny buggers too. 
The two re-animated soldiers are slowly wandering about near the bunker from which they emerged. They seem weak, disoriented. 
MENTZER
They are being controlled. We were, ah, fortunate to discover that we could turn off the fast mode using electromagnetic signals of a certain frequency. That tower you see contains transmitters that are broadcasting on that frequency.
FOCUS BRIEFLY ON TOWER. 
MASTERSON
(Grunts)
I suppose that’s good.
Well, doctor, are you going to show me something new, or are those two going to just drool on themselves? 
MENZTER
Watch what happens when I turn off the signal. 
Mentzer reaches to a switch mounted on the front of the observation tower and flips it. 
CLOSE ON: FACES OF RE-ANIMATED BODIES
First, we see that one of the bodies is the soldier who stood with Shevosky in the laboratory.  
Second, we see the re-animated soldiers go from slow-walking automatons to terrifyingly fast and nimble aggressors. They spot the machine gun emplacement a hundred yards distant, scream, and sprint toward it, taking hits but weaving to avoid fire. They make it about seventy yards and then fall down, their eyes still locked on the machine gun nest, their mouths opening and closing.
Masterson spits out his cigar. 
MASTERSON
What in God’s name was that? Why did they just fall down?
MENTZER
Ah . . . in fast mode, they quickly run out of energy.
MASTERSON
Why?
MENTZER
(Beat) Well . . . they don’t eat. That is to say, we haven’t found anything they like to eat . . . yet. They just attack anything living. 
MASTERSON
(Beat) Worthless! Absolutely worthless! 
MENZTER
We have a few more details to work out. Give us another year.
MASTERSON
I’ll give you a month, doctor! If this project doesn’t pan out by then, I’ll personally pull the plug! . . . This country has wasted enough money on this farce.

INT. - PLUM ISLAND LABORATORY – DAY
SUPER: NOVEMBER 1977
Colonel Masterson sits at a table in a large laboratory, impatiently tapping his fingers and chewing on his cigar. To one side is a student’s desk at which sits a women pecking at a typewriter, her back to the room and a scarf tied around her head. In the background, cloth-covered bodies lie on examining tables. 
Dr. Mentzer enters through a sturdy metal door.
MASTERSON
Looks at Mentzer taking his seat and scowls. 
Good of you to join me doctor. I’ve only been waiting twenty minutes in this stinking morgue of yours.
MENTZER
My apologies, Colonel. I was checking the results from the last series of injections; it looks quite promising this time.
MASTERSON
Not sure it matters, doctor. My orders are to close this money-wasting exercise in futility. Until this country has a need for mindless automatons or freaks that faint from hunger, I see no future for this life-sustaining virus of yours. 
Mentzer nods as though expecting to hear what the colonel just said.
MENTZER
I will admit that the results were not all that we hoped for, but we had our successes. The faster re-animates . . . 
MASTERSON
Re-animates? Is that what you call them? 
(Laughs)
For God’s sake, doctor! You are creating zombies!
Masterson rises and walks over to the pale typist. He grabs her shoulders and wrenches her around so that she is facing the table. He then removes the scarf; the head is disfigured by a bullet wound under her chin and a gaping hole in the top of her head. 
MASTERSON
Your own secretary killed herself rather than continue working in this house of horrors, and you use her dead body to make her an example of what this project has become!
Mentzer shakes his head and raises his hands imploringly. 
MENTZER
Miss Bartlett was overwrought. Her untimely death had nothing to do with this project . . . I merely sought what was best for her family; they are devout Catholics. 
Masterson frowns, not buying a word of what the doctor says. 
CLOSE ON: COLONELS’S HAND, WHICH CLINCHES MISS BARTLETT’S SHOULDER. 
In the background, Miss Bartlett stares at the hand. HER LIPS PART. 
MASTERSON
Best for whom, doctor? Even your Roosky accomplice, Shevosky, had the humanity to run away when he realized what is going on here! There’s something fundamentally wrong with bringing the dead back to life! 
(Beat) He called me yesterday. 
Mentzer’s eyes widen.
MASTERSON
Shevosky said Nevisky wasn’t just killed in an accident. 
Mentzer jumps to his feet. 
MENTZER
He lies!
MASTERSON
Did he? We didn’t speak long. He said he wanted to meet. Then he hung up.
Mentzer sits back down. He is wary but more relaxed.
MENTZER
So, you haven’t met him yet? 
MASTERSON
Not that it is any business of yours, doctor, but no. I have not met with Shevosky. 
You told me Nevisky was caught in a crossfire caused by one of your . . . zombies. I questioned the wisdom of putting weapons in the hands of those things, but I trusted you; I hope my trust was not misplaced. 
Mentzer nods. 
MENTZER
Yes. It was most unfortunate . . .  
Mentzer smiles and suddenly changes the topic. 
You know, colonel, you were right on one point: the Russians cannot see the potential for this project. They lack the . . .  entrepreneurial spirit. 
Maybe you have to grow up in a capitalistic economy to understand. Even if military applications of this project don’t pan out, the commercial opportunities . . .
Masterson laughs. 
MASTERSON
Commercial opportunities? Have your lost your fucking mind, doctor? Your slow zombies are too stupid to get out of their own way, and your fast zombies have all of the staying power of a teenage boy getting his first piece of pussy! What commercial opportunities can there be?
MOMENTARY CLOSE ON COLONEL’S HAND AND MISS BARTLETT’S MOUTH, WHICH OPENS AND CLOSES IN AN UNSETTLING PANTOMIME OF CHEWING.
MENTZER
Well, colonel, we . . . ah . . . recently discovered what the fast “zombies,” as you call them, like to eat. They can stay animated indefinitely when they are fed. . . It, um, was something that Dr. Nevisky—Ivan—discovered actually. 
Masterson crosses his arms.
MASTERSON
Now you tell me? 
MENTZER
(Shrugs) It took some time to confirm the finding. By then we . . . I, could no longer ignore the commercial ramifications of . . .
MASTERSON
What the fuck are you babbling about, doctor? What commercial opportunities?
Mentzer stands up. He shrugs. 
MENTZER
(Talking to himself more than the colonel.) 
Dr. Shevosky just couldn’t seem to grasp the potential after what happened to Ivan. He became so . . . emotional. He wasn’t thinking like a scientist! 
Mentzer walks slowly, head down, hands behind his back, seemingly lost in thought. When he stops and turns back to the table, he is close to the door. 
MASTERSON
What commercial opportunities, doctor? 
MENTZER
Mentzer looks up. He seems to be looking through the colonel, at something beyond. 
I know people, colonel. People with money who have a long-range economic vision of the world. They predict that soon the U.S. will no longer be a manufacturing economy; it will be a service economy. 
Masterson opens his mouth to speak, but Dr. Mentzer holds up a hand. 
MENTZER
The vibrancy of our economy will drive wages to the point where cheaper foreign labor is required if American products are competitive. 
In fact, we will reach the point where services will have to be . . . now what is the term they used?
MASTERSON
Doctor! Have you flipped? 
Mentzer’s face brightens as he recalls the word he was looking for. 
MENTZER
Outsourced! They say that services will be outsourced to other countries, like, like . . . India. In twenty years, when you call your insurance company to ask a question about your policy, your call will be answered by somebody in India who will answer your questions as though they were just down the street and not half a world away.  
MASTERSON
You’re mad! A raving lunatic! No wonder Shevosky left. 
MENTZER
(Talking to himself again, growing angry) Taking the place of an American worker! Weakening our economy!  
MASTERSON
You’ve become a loony! 
Mentzer’s head snaps up. 
MENTZER
Have I? 
Mentzer points to the zombie that was his secretary. 
Miss Bartlett no longer requires a salary at all, and she works longer hours. She can, in fact, work around the clock if she is fed! 
Masterson looks down at Miss Bartlett, who is staring at him and slowly licking her lips. 
MASTERSON
(Beat) What the devil . . .?
MENTZER
She has a faster gear. I just have to release her. 
Masterson looks around the room, and then up. Mounted to the ceiling is a black half -globe from which cylinders protrude.  On the bottom a green light glows.
MASTERSON
You bastard! What game are you playing?
MENTZER
I intend to reshape how America does business, colonel . . . and protect her status as a leader of commerce. 
MASTERSON
You won’t get away with killing me!
MENTZER
It is difficult to prove murder without a body, colonel, and my creations eat everything: flesh, organs, even bones . . .  
Oh, in Miss Bartlett’s desk is a gun. I believe you will understand what to do.
Masterson frantically PUSHES MISS BARTLETT TO THE FLOOR and retrieves a gun from the book bin of her desk. He jacks a shell into the chamber and points the gun at Dr. Mentzer, across the room. 
By the time he has turned, Dr. Mentzer has opened the door and is standing behind it, with only his head showing. 
MENTZER
There is only one bullet in that gun, colonel. . . I would choose wisely if I were you. 
Animals typically kill their prey before eating them.

Guard 1 steps aside and waits for the prisoners to enter. The guards stand close to the doors.

Stay and watch. (Chuckles) How many guards do you need to watch guys get a bite?
Woody has no response, but he senses something bad is about to happen. 
Guard 1 backs out, and then comes the distinctive CLICK of the doors being locked. Guard l looks through one of the windows briefly, grinning.

Woody hangs up. The SCREAMS outside continue and, after a minute or so, slacken off. 
Woody places his ear against the door; he hears scattered pieces of conversation:
“Jesus! Fucking mess . . .”
“…do a good job of eating everything, even the bones.”
“…lot of blood, still. ..”

Distant sounds of men YELLING, SCREAMING, and a muffled SHOTGUN BLAST.
ARJUN
Jesus! Now what?
ROSA
Let’s get out of here!
OSCAR
Are you kidding? Those guards could come back by any second. 
PEDRO
(Whining)I still really have to pee.
ARJUN
Shh!
Sounds of FOOTSTEPS APPROACHING. A group goes by. Arjun eases up to see the guards headed out. The footsteps fade, followed by the sound of a door slamming. 
ARJUN
Okay, that was the guards.
PEDRO
Can’t take it any more.
Pedro stands and bolts out of the opening between the pallets and trots in the direction of the cafeteria. 
ARJUN
(Stands)
I’m following him! Maybe I can get some pictures of the prisoners working. 
Billy N and Bobby N, after briefly looking at each other, follow Arjun.
OSCAR
(Standing and looking at Rosa) You still want to leave or . . .
Rosa stands and moves after the others. 
ROSA
I don’t want to split up. Let’s just get this over with. 
Oscar and Rosa walk down the aisle and then cut across an opening. Ahead, they see Arjun, the Nguyen brothers, and the swinging doors of the cafeteria. 
Oscar and Rosa are last to enter the cafeteria. They stand next to the Nguyen brothers, who are looking at the room: the concrete floors are wet and shiny, and the walls are also wet. Across the room, Arjun is peering though the windows on the other entry, holding up his phone to record. Pedro is nowhere to be seen.
OSCAR
(Looking at the wet walls and floor)
Messy eaters, huh? 
I wonder what all the screaming and the gunshot was about?
BILLY N
Maybe somebody not eat all his vegetables. 
ROSA
(Irritated) 
I’m going to tell Arjun to hurry it up.
Rosa walks over to Arjun, followed by the others. As they approach, Arjun holds up a finger to his lips. Oscar and the Nguyen brothers immediately ease up to the window and look, then pull away, startled expressions on their faces. 
Rosa is the last to look. On the other side the workers they saw earlier are loading boxes onto pallets. 
FOCUS ON FRESH BLOOD ON FACES AND CLOTHES OF ZOMBIES.
ROSA
(Loudly)
Jesus! What . . .
BILLY N
Maybe they eat?
OSCAR
Yeah? But eat what?
ARJUN
Where are the prisoners the guards marched in here?
OSCAR
What? You aren’t suggesting . . .
ROSA
I want to get out of here!
OSCAR
(Looking at Arjun) He’s just trying to get us to stay long enough to find out where the prisoners went. 
ROSA
But the blood . . .
OSCAR
Hello! Halloween?
On the other side of the cafeteria, Pedro comes out of the toilet, smiling. He walks toward the others but pauses as he passes by the freezer door. 
PEDRO
Hey! I think there’s somebody in here.
The others walk over. Sporadic THUMPING comes from the door.
PEDRO
Sounds like somebody is trapped inside. 
Pedro reaches for the door handle.
BOBBY N
Maybe that where they put prisoners. 
Pedro’s hand stops. 
ARJUN
If it is, then we close the door again real fast. 
PEDRO
(Looks at the Nguyen brothers)
The Viet Cong will help me. 
BILLY N
We not VC! We Americans!
BOBBY N
That right. Grandpa Nguyen only VC in family. 
PEDRO
(Sighs)
Just get over here and help me close this door fast if we need to. 
Billy and Bobby move in next to Pedro, their hands on the door. 
PEDRO
I’ll open on the count of three. If we need to close, I’ll shout “shut!” Okay?
One, two, three!
Pedro yanks opens the door to expose Woody, who is holding his flashlight at them and blinking in surprise. 
WOODY
Who the fuck are you?
ARJUN
You’re one of the guards. What’s going on here?
WOODY
(Defiantly) You tell me!
Bobby N slams the door shut. They immediately hear thumping on the other side. Pedro pulls the door open. 
BOBBY N
Man in freezer no demand explanation from people nice enough let him out!
BILLY N
Man in freezer say “Thank you” and hope not be left locked in freezer.
WOODY
(Apologetic) 
Okay, thanks. 
I was set up. The other guards left me with the prisoners, and the prisoners took my gun and locked me in here.
ARJUN
And where are the prisoners now?
WOODY
(Shrugs) 
I don’t know. I didn’t see anything. . . I just, uh, heard stuff.
ARJUN
We heard a gunshot and some screams. What was that all about?
WOODY
(Beat) I don’t know. All I know is that there were prisoners locked in this cafeteria, and (looks around) now there ain’t no prisoners. 
ARJUN
I need to find them.
WOODY
Man, I think we need to get out of here. (Beat) I heard some weird shit. 
ROSA
Yes! Listen to the security professional! I agree. 
ARJUN
Look, we already guessed that they use the prisoners as a source of free labor. I just want to document that fact.
WOODY
I don’t think they make the prisoners work.
ARJUN
Then what do they do with them? We saw them come in here.
WOODY
(Swallows hard) I think they were all killed while I was in the freezer. 
And I think I was supposed to have been killed with them. If they catch us here . . .
ROSA
Yes--They’ll kill us all! 
Okay, we’re going.

Arjun, Bobby N, Oscar, Pedro, Rosa, and Woody are running through the warehouse, out the door, across the pavement, and past the trucks with “America Still Works!” on the side. The rain is pelting down, propelled by strong winds. 
A huge bank of clouds is moving overhead, bringing lighting and THUNDER. The winds start gusting even stronger.

ARJUN
I don’t see why I couldn’t have stayed for just a little longer.

(Panting) Fine! Go back inside then.  
They are almost to an 80s vintage panel van with a fantasy paint job and a late model four-wheel drive extended cab pickup with a metal storage bin when a voice calls out. 
GUARD 1
Hold it right there shitsticks! 
They stop. A flash of lighting illuminates a truck parked with its back facing them. On the sides are painted the words “America Still Works!” Standing to the side of the truck is Guard 1, pointing an assault rifle at them in one hand; with the other hand, he opens the doors and pulls out a ramp that CLANGS on the pavement.
Another flash of lightening reveals a black half-globe mounted to the ceiling of the truck, black cylinders sticking out from it. Underneath the globe are about a dozen zombies, slowly rocking back and forth. 
GUARD 1 (OS)
See you met some friends Woody. 
I’m glad, you know, because not everybody got to eat. 
Lightning shows a second guard behind the zombies, prodding them down to the pavement with his shotgun.
WOODY
I don’t like this. Move! We need to get out of here! Now!
Woody thrusts them forward. Oscar opens the door of the van, and everybody except for the Nguyen brothers pile inside; the Nguyen brothers climb into their pickup. 
CUT TO TRUCK 
Guard 1 takes a small box from his pocket that has a green light on top and grins. 
CUT TO VAN
Oscar searches his pockets for the keys he just used to open the doors. They aren’t there.
CUT TO OUTSIDE
Lightning flashes; Guard 2 is still pushing the zombies in their direction as a rain squall hits, hiding them from view. 
CUT TO VAN
Oscar sees the keys on the ground outside. He opens the door, lunges, and grabs them, then straightens and jams the ignition key into the switch. RAIN POUNDS ON THE VAN. He turns the key, and the engine ROARS. 
He turns on the lights, but they see nothing out the front window because of the rain cascading down. Oscar JAMS the transmission into drive and turns on the windshield washers to reveal very active zombies chewing on the twitching body of Guard 2 as blood washes over the pavement. Three of the zombies jump up and start running toward the van.
ARJUN
Good God! What is that? Are they . . . eating him?
CUT TO: AMERICAN STILL WORKS TRUCK
Guard 1 looks at the device in his hand, which still shows a green light. He had not turned off the infrared transmitter. 
GUARD 1
What the fuck? 
Lightning flashes, showing five zombies rushing at Guard 1. Guard 1 tosses the box down and levels his rifle.
CUT TO: VAN
The van’s wheels SQUEAL as it fishtails out of the parking lot, hitting two zombies and then barreling down the road. Right behind it is the Nguyen brother’s truck.

This hurricane will be the best thing that ever happened to American Still Works!, the state of Texas, and the United States of America. 
Gentlemen, when this storm is over, everybody will see that companies who had the foresight to use America Still Works! contracted labor didn’t just survive when other companies shuttered up their doors—they thrived! 
FOCUS ON MAN IN LEFT CHAIR (SENATOR BINGHAM)
SENATOR BINGHAM
I am sure, Dr. Mentzer, but people are starting to ask questions about how American Still Works operates. Some executives aren’t comfortable turning over their warehouse operations to a work force they are contractually obligated not to see. 
It is . . . odd.
MENTZER
(Smiling) For their own good, senator, for their own good. If they don’t know the details, then they have nothing to say when anti-business liberal reporters ask questions. 
There are proprietary interests at stake here, gentlemen.
The other man (CONGRESSMAN MONSON) leans forward. 
CONGRESSMAN MONSON
Granted, but I’ve gotten similar questions from constituents, Dr. Mentzer. People are concerned that American Still Works is replacing American workers with . . . robots. 
MENTZER
(Laughs) 
I can absolutely assure you that America Still Works! is not replacing American workers with robots! (Beat) We are simply taking back the kinds of jobs that have either been filled by illegal immigrants or outsourced overseas. We want to protect American business—not run it into the ground!
CONGRESSMAN MONSON
Yes, but people see those trucks of yours, yet nobody ever sees any people except for the drivers, so they get curious as to who your people are. 
I am sure I don’t need to remind you that the government-backed loan guarantee your company received for business expansion comes with an obligation to be somewhat transparent, Dr. Mentzer. 
MENTZER
We will eventually reveal all. But, for now, we need to maintain our competitive edge. (Beat) Would you ask Coca Cola to reveal their secret ingredient, or would you just enjoy drinking their product?
SENATOR BINGHMAN
Coca Cola doesn’t have a problem with people who disappear without a trace, Dr. Mentzer. I have heard a disturbing report about state prisoners, who seem to be a part of your work groups in some mysterious way. I got a call from the mother of a missing prisoner who demands that I account for her son’s sudden disappearance. 
MENTZER
Tell me, senator, what was her son incarcerated for?
SENATOR BINGHAM
Well, first degree murder, but I don’t see . . .
MENTZER
So a convicted murderer has gone from being a drain on society to being an integral part of restoring our industrial base. 
I don’t see any negatives. 
SENATOR BINGHAM
But he’s unaccounted for, and . . .
MENTZER
I assure you, this miscreant cannot possibly pose any future threat to society. He has paid his debt in full by playing a vital role within America Still Works!
CONGRESSMAN MONSON
How? The prisoners you use may be murderers and pedophiles, but what purpose do they serve within America Still Works!?
SENATOR BINGHAM
People want to know what American Still Works! does with those prisoners. Even prisoners have rights.

Shevosky stops and looks at Woody’s uniform.

It’s very nice Dr. Mentzer, but I don’t see anything out of the ordinary. So far, America Still Works! looks like the rest of America.

You want to see paradigm-breaking efficiency, senator? Follow me. Let me show you the secret to America Still Works.
Mentzer walks through the front offices to a gray metal door marked “Authorized Personnel Only” and presses buttons on a key pad.

I have to agree with the congressman, Dr. Mentzer. This display is in bad taste and rather juvenile: zombie makeup? Really? 
MENTZER
(Dismayed) But these are real zombies. 
Here, let me show you.
Mentzer walks over to the zombie with the gashed cheek, grabs it by the arm, and pulls it over to the two politicians. He pulls open the zombie’s mouth and then sticks his fingers through the opening in the mouth.
MENTZER
See?
SENATOR BINGHAM
(Wrinkling his nose) What is that smell?

Decaying flesh. 
He grabs the opening in the cheek of the zombie and tears off a strip that has turned chalky gray.

CONGRESSMAN MONSON
Good God! You truly are using zombies! 
Are you insane?

But I haven’t answered your question about how prisoners fit into our strategy here at America Still Works! 
Follow me. 
Mentzer walks toward double doors with small windows near the back of the warehouse, beckoning for the others to follow. Going though the doors are a small group of orange-clad prisoners shepherded by guards. 
Mentzer steps up to the head guard. 
MENTZER
Got room for a couple more? They want a bite.
The guard glances at the two elected officials. If he recognizes them, he doesn’t indicate it; he simply nods in the direction of the cafeteria door. 
Mentzer holds out his hand and moves aside. 
MENTZER

We’ll stay just long enough to get to the truth of the matter, sir!
The senator steps inside.

The fast variant of the virus made the reanimate capable of great speed and violence, but at the price of huge energy expenditure: they must eat frequently to sustain such bursts.

(With disgust) 
But . . . human flesh? Why not hamburgers or steak for crying out loud?
SHEVOSKSY
Oh, they will eat other living flesh—dogs, cats, cows, birds—but, in an urban environment, human flesh is the food most readily available. 
As to why they only eat living flesh, we do not know. It may be a reaction imposed by the host virus. Memories of being alive could cause the host to seek a return to the way it used to be. Perhaps eating living flesh seems like a way to return.

Speaking as veterinarian, that sound like crackpot theory to me.

Shevosky picks up the device.
SHEVOSKY
We initially thought the fast zombies are calmed by infrared radiation, but that was a just a fluke; the transmitter we used that first time—quite by accident--was not precise. It leaked other frequencies. 
Further experiments showed that an extremely high frequency signal of 275 gigahertz works best. Unfortunately . . .

SHEVOSKY

You know your radio frequencies my friend.

My dad’s company makes garage door openers and infrared sensors. I kind of grew up around radio stuff. 
SHEVOSKY
Most interesting. (Beat) Could you manufacture something small that continuously broadcasts at 275 gigahertz? A lot of them? Slowing down the zombies is our best hope of controlling them. 
OSCAR
Sure, but if it’s battery powered, it will eventually run down. 
SHEVOSKY
(Shrug)
It doesn’t matter. We just need enough transmitters to blanket an area; even in a strong rain, some signals should make it through. 
If we can keep the zombies slow, we have a chance to disable them. If they are fast, well . . .
LEV
They disable us instead. 
Shevosky nods in agreement and looks back at Oscar. 
OSCAR
I’ll go to my dad’s plant and get started.

As Oscar and Rosa drive off, the Russians gather their bags of weapons and carry them to the van, followed by Arjun, Pedro, and Woody. 
The Nguyen brothers walk to their truck. Billy N vaults into the bed and removes keys from a pocket. 
BILLY N
Wait moment. Need get guns out. 
PEDRO
Figures. I imagine those two Asian rednecks would have their deer rifles with them at all times. 
Billy N unlocks the storage unit in the bed of the truck, and removes two well-worn AK-47s and several spare ammo clips. He hands these to his brother, while Arjun and Pedro stand with their mouths open.
BILLY N
(Looks at puzzled faces)
Family keepsakes. Grandpa Nguyen bring guns when immigrate to U.S. after war over. 
Lev gently takes one of the rifles from Bobby N, looks it over, nods, and then hands it back.
LEV
Nice gun. 
(Looking up and around at the others)Okay, let’s roll!
Lev takes the wheel of Oscar’s van; Yakov, Grisha, Arjun, and Pedro take seats. Lev starts the van, slams it into drive, and fishtails out of the parking lot, taking out a stop sign on the way. 
The Nguyen’s truck follows.

Without slowing, Lev slews the van down the exit ramp, cuts across the intersection, taking out the stop sign, cuts right once more, and then they are northbound on the feeder road that leads back to the warehouse. A large sign out front proclaims “New World Distributing.” Just beyond the sign are four America Still Works! trucks. 
The van squeals into the lot and stops. The Nguyen’s truck pulls in next. 
Yakov and Grisha exit and begin pulling weapons out of the bags. Lev hands shotguns and pistols to Arjun, Pedro, and Woody.

Oh.
WOODY
They’ll have guards, won’t they?
LEV
Guards no problem. I show you.
Lev walks forward briskly, a shotgun in his hand and two more strapped across his back. He kicks open the locked glass doors of the warehouse offices and advances on a guard station where FAT GUARD watches with wide eyes. 
FAT GUARD
Hey! You guys can’t just . . .
Lev jacks a shell into the chamber, shoots the communication console, and smoothly jacks another shell into the chamber.

Get out!
Fat Guard bolts, holding onto a belt that supports a sagging belly. His small revolver bangs against his hip as he disappears through the doors. 
Lev turns to a gray door marked “Authorized Personnel Only,” shoots out the door lock, and kicks the door open, revealing a large warehouse in which many zombies are working. The zombies are all dressed in blue coveralls on which “NWD” has been embroidered in large block letters.

The Russians walk straight up to the zombies and begin shooting at point-blank range: first, a single shot in the head. Once each zombie has fallen, they put another slug into the head.

Woody moves next to Lev, his shotgun pointed at the door, as a shadow flickers across the opening. An instant later, two zombies wearing blue jumpsuits with the word “GLOBAL” embroidered on the front burst through, moving quickly toward them. 
The Russian and Woody fire. They chamber new shells just as three more zombies burst through; they shoot both and Lev has chambered a shell when a third shot from the side takes it out. 
Pedro stands next to Lev, his shotgun smoking.
PEDRO. 
You’re welcome. 
Lev grunts his appreciation and turns back to the door as more zombies come at them, howling. The Nguyens start firing on full automatic, and the pile of zombie bodies grows. 
LEV YELLS AT GRISHA
Grisha! The miniguns! 
Grisha throws down his shotgun and dashes back to the bags. He pulls out two multiple-barreled machine guns and hurries back, belts of ammo trailing behind him. He hands the miniguns to Lev and Yakov, and then retrieves the third for himself.

I have to admit, using zombies as cheap labor is, frankly, genius. You don’t have to pay them. Just feed them murderers, rapists, and pedophiles, which reduces overcrowding of the prisons. It’s a win-win situation.

SHEVOSKY
(With great sorrow, talking to zombie) 
Ivan. You should have been allowed to die my old friend. What has he done to you?
MENTZER
You were wondering where our workers come from. You would be fascinated, Dr. Shevosky, to know what the virus does when you give it to a patient with a terminal disease. 
SHEVOSKY
You monster!
MENTZER
(Clicking tongue) 
Oh, quite the contrary, doctor. 
(Pointing to bodies on floor) They sung my praises! The virus cured these people who were dying, giving them additional years to spend with family and friends. 
Mentzer lifts his arms to the heavens.
I cured cancer! 
SHEVOSKY
Nonsense! We long suspected the virus might attack cancer cells that threaten the host. But we would never use the virus as a cure, knowing what would happen after the body dies. The virus exists to propagate! It resurrects its host because doing so gives it the best chance of passing to other hosts. 
MENTZER
Sure sounds like a cancer cure to me!  
SHEVOSKY
How did the families of your “cured” patients react when their loved ones came back to life shortly after dying? 
MENTZER
(With look of mock surprise)
Dr. Shevosky, do you assume that we made no advances after you abandoned us? My researchers discovered a way to inhibit the spread of the virus for several days—long enough for us to recover the bodies. 
SHEVOSKY
I still call you “monster” for injecting virus into living patients. 
MENTZER
(Waving hand in dismissal)
Sticks and stones, doctor. All entrepreneurs have their detractors. 
(Appears to think for a moment)
Let me give you an example of another innovation I introduced. Do you realize that America Still Works! cannot meet the growing demand for cheap labor simply by injecting terminal patients and waiting for them to die? 
(Looks at Shevosky and others as though expecting a rely)
No? Well, let me assure you that we cannot. Consequently, we have had to be much more aggressive in finding and recruiting workers. 
BILLY N
What you mean? You kill people? 
MENTZER
(Shaking his head)
The fundamental principles of capitalism are seldom grasped by those who come from third-world countries. No, Charlie, I would never dream of just “killing people.” 
We recruit from an enemy population that has been stealing American jobs for decades. We capture them and make them work for nothing. 
PEDRO
Are you talking about illegal aliens? 
MENTZER
Yes! Exciting isn’t it? We are recruiting illegals all across the country and putting them to work in a way that doesn’t sap the resources of this great nation! All we ask is that they accept an “inoculation injection” before starting their new jobs. The injection actually contains both the virus and a potent toxin.
SHEVOSKY
Murderer!
MENTZER
(Shaking head)
Where would civilization be if nobody pushed the envelope now and then? We took lemons—in the form of job-stealing illegals—and made lemonade!
Now, doctor Shevosky, I know the whole “injecting healthy people” thing, even if those people are illegals, seems to run contrary to your high Russian ideals, so let me assure you that the toxin we administer to our wetback friends results in a painless death; we are not animals.
PEDRO
You bastard! You are an animal!
Mentzer smiles at Pedro
You’ll be glad to know, Pedro, that America Still Works! also takes volunteers. I have a spot waiting for you. 
PEDRO
(Confused) 
How do you know my name?
BILLY N
He not. He call you Pedro as racist insult—just like he call me Charlie. 
MENZTER
Oh, I’m not racist, Charlie: we’ll grab our share of illegal Canucks before we are finished, and then there are all those billions of Chinks. 
SHEVOSKY
Monster!
MENTZER 
(Turing to face Shevosky and smiling)
Dr. Shevosky, how can I thank you and Dr. Nevisky? You not only invented the virus, but you also discovered the means to control the infected. 
Mentzer holds his hand near a small black object that dangles from a lanyard around his neck: an EHF transmitter A small green light indicates that it is operating. 
Without you, none of this would have been possible. Isn’t capitalism freaking wonderful?
Dr. Shevosky looks at the zombie Dr. Nevisky. The zombie turns his eyes to Mentzer and pantomimes chewing; when he turns his eyes back to Shevosky, he stops. 
SHEVOSKY
I . . .
Shevosky stops talking as Dr. Nevisky again turns to Mentzer and chews, then turns back to Shevosky and stops. 
MENTZER
Speechless, Dr. Shevosky? Well, I suppose all has been said that needs to be said. 
(Bows slightly)
Gentlemen, I bid you adieu. I trust Dr. Nevisky will entertain you in my absence after I turn off my device. 
Mentzer and Jimmy lower their weapons and walk back through the doors. A moment later, Dr. Nevisky screams and bolts through the door in pursuit. Shortly thereafter come SCREAMS and SNAPPING OF BONES. 
Shevosky runs to the door to see Dr. Nevisky tearing out the throat of Jimmy, the driver. Nevisky SCREAMS at Shevosky then runs the other way, in pursuit of Mentzer.

Shevosky hangs up.
Arjun looks out the window. Debris is everywhere: the smaller pieces FLYING through the air; here and there are sections of roofing material ripped from buildings alongside the freeway.

Several zombies, their mouths smeared with blood poke their heads out of the door and window of the van as the truck pulls closer. 
Flashes coming from the interior of the limo indicate somebody is putting up a fight.

A SCREAM from behind them causes them all to turn. The Dr. Nevisky zombie is standing in the truck bed. He jumps out and begins running toward Mentzer, who has wriggled out of the limo. Mentzer runs to the edge of the freeway, climbs over, and disappears into the darkness. The Nevisky zombie vaults after him. 
ANGLE ON: limo and van. The lights of the Nguyens’ truck shows a solid wall of zombies running toward them, SCREAMING as they come. 
ARJUN
Maybe we should get out of here?
Lights hit them from behind as Woody and the Russians arrive; the three Russians disembark and immediately start firing with their miniguns. Woody emerges with an assault rifle and two shotguns strapped across his back—he starts firing. The rest join them, firing whatever they have.

Okay, we stay and fight instead. 
Arjun starts shooting his shotgun. In seconds, the zombies are all put down.

The zombies SCREAM and begin sprinting forward.

The Nguyen brothers position themselves between the Russians and start firing their AKs. Arjun and Pedro position themselves in a couple of openings and wait, holding their shotguns until the mass of zombies comes into range; as the first ones come even with the limo and van, they begin firing. 
A ridge of zombie bodies begins forming in the roadway, but the zombies keep coming, climbing over their fellow undead to get at warm flesh. 
Lev’s minigun is the first to run out of ammo, followed by Grisha and then Yakov. Each grabs an assault rifle from the pile at their feet and continues blasting away, but the wave of zombies keeps coming, and coming, and coming. 
Lev throws down his empty rifle and picks up one of the tactical shotguns at his feet. He chambers shells, shoots, and chambers again until he is out of shells; then he picks up the second shotgun, chambers a shell, and takes a moment to look at the wave of zombies.

The Russians cheer and walk forward to take out the slowed down zombies. They are joined by Woody and the Nguyen brothers, who have taken a real shine to zombie slaying. 
The wind slows. Arjun and the others look up. 
ARJUN
I think the worst is over. 
OSCAR
Good. The way it was blowing, I was afraid we wouldn’t get here in time to . . .
He finally sees his van, which is a mess.
OSCAR
Dudes, what did you do to . . . 
SHEVOSKY
(Picking up one of the rolling EHF transmitters.)
You say you have more of these? 
OSCAR
(Beat) Yeah—in the back of the other van . . . but what happened to my . . . 
Shevosky takes out his phone and taps in a number. In the background, we see Lev answer his phone. 
OSCAR
(Looking at Arjun and Pedro)
Guys, what happened to my van?
PEDRO
Been kinda crazy here, man.
Arjun nods in agreement.
Lev, Yakov, Grisha, and Woody come walking up. In the background, sporadic shots indicate the Nguyen brothers mopping up the remaining zombies. 
LEV
(Speaking to Shevosky)
We go now.
(Turning to Woody)
You drive and shoot good! You like Mexican food?
WOODY
(Perplexed) Yeah. Sure. 
LEV
Good place eat in El Paso. We go and continue saving America, da?
WOODY
(Chuckles) Me and a group of Russians will save America?
(Shrugs) Sure. Why not?
Lev turns to Oscar, tosses him the keys to his nearly demolished van and holds out a hand.  
LEV
(Motioning with head at Oscar’s beat-up van) Old van kaput.
(Motioning with head at BigTex Garage Doors van.) We take new van instead. You make more little balls, yeah?
PEDRO
(Whispering to Arjun)
Talk about balls . . . 
Oscar looks at the big Russian for a few moments, sighs, and tosses over the keys. 
Lev hands the keys to Woody, who climbs into the driver’s seat of the new van while the Russians pile in with their gear. They gently toss one bag of transmitters out. 
Lev climbs into the passenger’s seat, leans out the window, and yells to Shevosky.
LEV
Take care of Papka for me!
Shevosky nods.
ARJUN
Wait. Did he say take care of his papa? Who . . . 
SHEVOSKY
Dr. Nevisky. (Beat) Lev is his son. 
The white van fishtails away.
Shevosky rubs his hands together, picks up the bag of transmitters, and gives it a shake. He looks at Oscar. 
We will finish cleaning up here while you make more of these? Da?
OSCAR
Looking at his van, the departing BigTex van, the carnage all around, and Shevosky
My vans!
PULL BACK TO REVEAL A FREEWAY STREWN WITH BODIES OF ZOMBIES, BULLET-RIDDEN VEHICLES, AND DEBRIS.

INT.– NEWSROOM (KHMX—PROUDLY SERVING THE HOUSTON METROPLEX!)– DAY
Close on: Morning news anchor Michael
MICHAEL
In the aftermath of Hurricane Claudette, reports continue to come in about deranged cannibals.
In fact, there were even reports that one of KHMX’s new crews captured footage of such a scene, but, apparently, that was not true, as Haylee Johnson reports. 
CUT TO HAYLEE, ON THE SCENE, STANDING NEXT A PIPE-SMOKING, SMILING MAN IN A SUIT. THEY ARE LOCATED ON THE FREEWAY, FROM WHICH DEBRIS IS BEING REMOVED BY DISTANT PEOPLE IN HAZMAT SUITS. 
HAYLEE
Yes, Michael. Although there were widespread reports of footage showing some sort of “zombie” attack last night, it has now been confirmed that it was all an act of imagination. 
I am joined here by DR. GLOPTON of the Department of Homeland Security, who has confirmed that the footage was undeniably fake.
CUT TO DR. GLOPTON, WHO SMILES AND REMOVES HIS PIPE. 
DR. GLOPTON
That’s correct, Haylee! In times of stress, people’s imaginations can run wild. They see Bigfoot, aliens, Elvis . . .
HAYLEE
Or even zombies?
DR. GLOPTON
(Chuckling) 
Yes. On Halloween, they may even see zombies, Haylee. 
(Frowning slightly) Not that I want to make light of the situation. This city was dealt a terrible blow by last night’s storm. A terrible blow!
HAYLEE
We are fortunate the National Guard was on hand to help with the cleanup, aren’t we?
Dr. Glopton turns slightly to regard a handful of soldiers in the distance. 
DR. GLOPTON
(Smiling) Very fortunate indeed. 
Two quick gunshots are heard, and the camera pans in the direction of the sound. 
HAYLEE (OS)
Goodness! What do you suppose . . . 
DR. GLOPTON
Glopton pulls the camera back around to focus on himself. 
(Smiling) 
Vermin of some sort, probably. All sorts of vermin are loose after a big storm. 
(He pauses dramatically) Why, I’m surprised we haven’t see werewolves. 
HAYLEE
Werewolves?
DR. GLOPTON
(Pointing off screen.) There . . . wolves. 
(Beat) Both Dr. Glopton and Haylee laugh at this cheesy homage to Young Frankenstein. 
HAYLEE
Oh Dr. Glopton! You had me there for a moment!
(Looking serious again.) Any last advice for our viewers?
DR. GLOPTON
(Looking into the camera)
Well, Haylee, I can only suggest that if the story sounds too fantastic to be true, you can be sure it is not!
Glopton smiles his biggest smile yet and touches his tie clip. 
CLOSE ON: TIE CLIP, WHICH HAS A SMALL GREEN LIGHT IN THE MIDDLE. 
HAYLEE
Back to you Michael!
MICHAEL
Thanks Haylee. 
Speaking of the Department of Homeland Security, that department announced today that all U.S. borders are closed to outgoing traffic, pending a review of border crossing protocol requested by the Mexican government. 
The shutdown is expected to be temporary.

INT. - APARTMENT, HOUSTON. – DAY
Arjun is looking at the images of his wife and daughter on the screen in his office. 
ARJUN
My apartment was little damaged, but with so much carnage to the city, Daman suggested a little R and R might be in order. 
WIFE
We will be so glad to have you home!
DAUGHTER
Get here soon, Daddy!
ARJUN
I am chatting with a ticket agent even as we speak. 
A small window opens on the screen, following by the message: “This is Andrew. How may I help you?”
Arjun types: “Is flight 775 to Mumbai still leaving on schedule?”
After a slight pause comes the message, “Yes.” 
Arjun types “Thank you.”
CUT TO: UNATURALLY WHITE FINGERS SLOWLY TYPING ON A KEYBOARD, IN FRONT OF WHICH APPEARS THE CHAT DIALOGUE WITH ARJUN. 
Zoom out just enough to reveal a chalky white neck with a horrific gash in which maggots crawl. 
The fingers type, “Have a nice trip.”
A SONG BEGINS: WHITE ZOMBIE’S “BLOOD, MILK, AND SKY” 
CONTINUE SLOWLY ZOOMING OUT
The zombie airline agent is revealed, sitting in a cubicle. As the camera continues to move back, we see more and more cubicles filled with zombies sitting in front of computer screens.
