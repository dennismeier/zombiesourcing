zsourcing
=========

*Zombiesourcing* is a screenplay I wrote after spending too many days reviewing water and wastewate projects for compliance with Idaho state code. A question popped into my head: What would happen if I died here of utter boredom here? Would my body keep typing out review comments? 
Some time later, the idea of zombie workers struck me as being a great staffing solution for those businesses who really don't give a rats-ass about employees. There are plenty of those around (not the State of Idaho by the way--I mostly enjoyed my tenure there), and they would cheerfully hire or anybody who doesn't have to be paid or go home after a shift. You could work zombies as hard as needed (they are already dead, after all), and maybe you feed them human flesh now and then to create more zombies.  
Better yet, what if there was a staffing service that provided an endless supply of zombie workers? Enter Dr. Stephen Mentzer, who reboots a failed DoD project to create reanimated soldiers into the company known as "America Still Works."
